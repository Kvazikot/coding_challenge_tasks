# Ideal gas simulation and demonstration of the second law of thermodynamics.
Once upon a time, I had a program that simulated the movement of gas molecules in a vessel with partitions.
In one part at the beginning of the experiment there were 10,000 particles in the other 0.
There was a partition in the center of the screen and molecules (small circles) could pass through it to another compartment.
During the collision of particles in it, the energy exchange was calculated according to the law of conservation of momentum.
After a few minutes of simulation, equilibrium was not established.
